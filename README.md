# rick and morty api
## quick connect to graphql + react

This is just a quick project to learn how to connect with a GraphQL database, with help from Apollo. It's not well styled or laid out (it's generally unpolished), but it gets the job done. This is a cool API and I will next create a new project that better consumes and displays the infomration.

### Languages / Tools

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Rick and Morty GraphQL database, Apollo Client
